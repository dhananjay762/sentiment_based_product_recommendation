# Sentiment Based Product Recommendation System

#### Have you ever wondered how e-commerce websites such as Amazon or Flipkart are giving you product recommendations that are quite similar to your likings or are similar to the products that you have already bought from these platforms?

Reviews and ratings given by the users for the products play a vital role in purchase decisions. Suppose you want to buy a particular product from any e-commerce website, you check the reviews of that product, and if people are giving positive responses or higher ratings then the product is considered good to buy and if there are more negative responses or lower ratings, then it is not considered a good buy. We know that there are a lot of users who buy, review and submit the reviews and ratings of products on e-commerce websites. Now, based on these reviews and ratings, we can recommend products to the users.

In this project, we have used e-commerce product reviews data set to build a product recommendation system for the end users. The recommendation has been improved using a sentiment analysis model. We have built a recommendation system to recommend products and a sentiment analysis model to fine-tune the recommendations that we get from the recommender system.


We have deployed the end-to-end project using Flask framework which has created a web application to deploy this ML model. To make the web application public, we have used Heroku, which works as the platform as a service (PaaS) and helps to build, run and operate application entirely on the cloud.
